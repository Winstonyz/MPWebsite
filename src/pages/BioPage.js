                She also supports students from these communities by co-founding
                a new scholarship at the RTA School of Media. A graduate of
                Ryerson University, Marci later returned to Ryerson as a
                distinguished visiting professor and by serving on its Board of
                Governors.

                After a remarkable career in journalism, Marci decided to enter
                federal politics when she announced her candidacy to represent
                Toronto Centre and subsequently, won the seat during an October
                2020 by-election.

              In October 2020, just a day after being elected to Parliament,
              Marci also released her first book titled "Off Script: Living Out
              Loud" where she shares personal milestones, tales of resilience
              and kindness, dramatic moments from her career as a journalist and
              insights from the many unforgettable people that she has met and
              interviewed. Marci is committed to being the voice of Toronto
              Centre constituents in the House of Commons and continuing the
              fight alongside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal
              caucus for inclusion, equality and ensuring that everyone in
              Toronto Centre and across Canada have a fair chance at success.
